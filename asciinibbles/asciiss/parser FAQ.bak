By default all elements have absolute position.

Position on X axis:
    If element has x coordinate (by left or right) it will be placed on it (position: absolute - by default)
    If element doesn`t have any style, than position will be inherit from parent
    If parent has two child elements without x on the same y, than first wiil be placed in the beginning, second after first
    If element has style position:relative than his x position will be added to parent x position

Position on Y axis
    If element has x coordinate (by top or bottom) it will be placed on it (position: absolute - by default)
    If element doesn`t have any style, than position will be inherit from parent
    If element has style position:relative than his y position will be added to parent y position
